1.
Take 10 integer inputs from user and store them in a list and print them on screen.

2.
Take 10 integer inputs from user and store them in a list. Again ask user to give a number. Now, tell user whether that number is present in list or not.
( Iterate over list using while loop ).

3. Try to to do this. Else we wiil do in class
Take 20 integer inputs from user and print the following:
number of positive numbers
number of negative numbers
number of odd numbers
number of even numbers
number of 0s.

4.
Take 10 integer inputs from user and store them in a list. Now, copy all the elements in another list but in reverse order.

5.
Write a program to find the sum of all elements of a list.

6.
Write a program to find the product of all elements of a list.

7.
Find largest and smallest elements of a list.

8.
Write a program to print sum, average of all numbers, smallest and largest element of a list.

9.
Make a list by taking 10 input from user. Now delete all repeated elements of the list.
E.g.-
INPUT : [1,2,3,2,1,3,12,12,32]
OUTPUT : [1,2,3,12,32]

10.
Take a list of 10 elements. Split it into middle and store the elements in two dfferent lists. E.g.-
INITIAL list :
58	24	13	15	63	9	8	81	1	78

After spliting :
58	24	13	15	63
9	8	81	1	78

11.
Ask user to give integer inputs to make a list. Store only even values given and print the list.
